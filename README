bs - A Basic Scheme Implementation
==================================
bs is an interpreter for a simple Scheme-like language that is in very early
development. But even when it is finished, it will still lack the more advanced
features of Scheme, such as macros and continuations.

The goal of bs is to implement enough of Scheme to boostrap a Scheme compiler
written in Scheme. A secondary goal is to learn about writing simple
interpreters.

This project was inspired by Peter Michaux's "Scheme from Scratch" project.

Compilation
============
To build bs, you'll need libgc and scons. Assuming you already have gcc
installed, you can install the neccessary packages on a Debian-based system
with this command:

    $ sudo apt-get install libgc-dev scons

Then type "scons" in the project directory to build bs.

If you are using a non-Debian-based system, or a different compiler, you'll
probably need to edit the SConstruct file.

There is a simple test script in the tests/ directory. Look at the comments at
the top of run-tests.sh for details.
